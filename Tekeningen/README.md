# 3D models

All parts are made in the software Inventor Professional 2021. To open the project the best thing to do is to open the assembly, "complete setup met relief", in the "13_11_2023" folder.

This way you open all the parts that are needed for this project and you can see how all the parts fit together. In the pictures below you will see the assembly with a numbering of what the parts are/what they do with the naming of this part. All the parts are 3D printed except the stand-offs and bought parts like the Raspberry Pi and barrel jack.

The folder with name "13_11_2023" is where al the latest pieces are. The other folder with name "13_11_2023 stukken niet meer nodig", are pieces who where made in the prototyping stage and are not needed anymore for the project.

If you want to remake this project on your own 3D printer that is possible with the 3D stl files provided in the map "STL 14-11-2023" and "STL 27-11-2023".

## Description of the parts

![case](../Images/3D%20README_2.png)
The name of each part in the 13_11_2023 folder is in brackets.

1. The highest case (Led behuizing dubbele hoogte).

2. The lower form of the case (Led behuizing).

3. The lid where the Pi is mounted on (Led deksel hub).

4. The lid without a Pi (Led deksel hub zonder pi).

5. Magnet stand-offs small box (magneet stand-offs).

6. Magnet (magneet).

7. This is the power barrel jack this is an assembly in an assembly (dc-barrel-jack-adapter-female).

8. Spacer to make it possible to use the magnets (spacer dubbele hoogte behuizing).

9. Spacer without the magnets for the big box (spacer dubbele hoogte behuizing zonder magneet).

10. This is the spacer for the higher box (mangeet stand-offs16 mm).

11. This is the raspberry pi (Raspberry Pi 4 Model B).

12. The Pi holder that is glued on the lid (houderpi).

13. This is the merge piece that keeps the two boxes together (koppelstuk).
