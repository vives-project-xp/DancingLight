## Introduction

## Project explained
The dancing light project will make LED's react to music. We will be working with a sound sensor which will send a signal depending on the strength of the sound/music. Using a rasberry pi 4 we can code a program to make this happen.
## Hardware
## Software
## Design
## Who does/did what?
- ### Global (entire group): 
1. Project defining (What's expected from the project)
2. Project design (Brainstorming about options, designing connection system for multiple products)
3. Material list (Searching cheapest solutions while mantaining quality)
4. Github issues 

- ### Mirko (Software & ai + Scrum master):
1. Software testing (Making a LED strip function as we want with the rasberry pi 4)
2. Searching code

- ### Seraphin (Software & ai):
1. Software testing (Making a LED strip function as we want with the rasberry pi 4)
2. Searching code

- ### William (Software & ai):
1. Poster design (Canva)

- ### Elias (Netwerken):
1. Looking for power supply solution
2. Case design

- ### Esteban (Software & ai):

2. README documentation
3. Searching code

- ### To be determined:
1. Testing product (week 7-10)/
    - Software and hardware
    - Casing (does the connection between two products work?)
2. Optimizing product:
    - ...
3. Document finalization: 
    - README
    - Powerpoint final presentation
    - ...
4. Preparing final presentation
5. Coding:
    - LED's on sound strength
    - Template lighting for LED's
