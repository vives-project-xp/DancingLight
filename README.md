## Project explained

The dancing light project will make LED's react to music.

We will be working with a sound sensor which will send a signal depending on the strength of the sound/music. Using a Raspberry Pi 4 we can code a program to make this happen. We used VNC for most of our programming (more info in software)
.
The project will have a few modes. Some generic effects will be added into a program. Lastly the mode which listens to audio input will also be implemented into the project. We use a USB mic to listen to the audio due to the rasberry only being able to take in digital input on the gpio pins. With this mic we can connect it to a USB port on the rasberry and make a program which can observe analog input. This way we can visualize sound strength, frequencies and other sound related variables. With the analog way we can only display light for the on and off state.

Taking the entire casing into a count it exists out of four different parts. The lid has some holes for air circulation and the top is printed very thin, just so the light of the LEDs is visible from the outside. At the sides a system was added to connect two cases with each other. It uses an external part to connect the sides. To ensure the same lighting in each box, we decided to add the rasberry to the back of the main box. This will make it so the main box will be coming forward when compared to the other boxes when connected to for example a wall. Originally we used to parts which would bridge over the rasberry to provide light all over the box, but this caused the issue that you could visually see the LED's on one side and only the light on the other side. 

## Effects
1. Audioreact
    a. LedsmeDB.py (Gets brighter based on the decibels)
    b. Uitbreidreactie.py (Leds lighten up on a scale red - green - blue based on decibels)
2. Rainbow
3. TwoColors
The red part simulates box 1 while the green part simulates the second box connected with one of the connectors.

## Hardware

Our projects requires the following hardware and materials to be constructed (links and pricing included in BOM list):
<hr>

1. Raspberry Pi 4
<br>
<img src="./Images/RasberryPi4.jpg" alt="rp4" width=300px>
<img src="./Images/rasberrypins.png" alt="rp4" width=300px>
We use a rasberry pi 4 to code our project, this is a powerfull way in which we can include many different effects.<br><br>

2. Stekkeradapter 5V 10A
<br>
<img src="./Images/Stekkeradapter.jpg" alt="stekkeradapter" width=300px>
Of course the rasberry pi 4 needs power to work, for that we use this adapter.<br><br>

3. Adapter -> DC
<br>

4. 3Pin Connector
<br>
<img src="./Images/3Pin.jpg" alt="3Pin" width=300px>
To connect LED strips we use these connectors, which can easily connect LED strips to eachother by just plugging one end into another. <br><br>

5. Ledstrip 5V
<br>

6. Geluidssensor
<br>
<img src="./Images/Geluidssensor.webp" alt="Geluidssensor" width=300px>
Dropped due to low sensitivity, could also only be connected to digital gpio pins. This way we had to work with a specific value to work around and can also only play an effect when this value is exceeded<br><br>

7. USB-microfoon
<img src="./Images/usbmic.jpg" alt="usb" width=300px>
We chose to use a different approach by using this usb mic to be able to take in analog input to create effects based on the strength of the sound. With some calculations found online we can determine the decibel rate of the sound. This mic is way more sensitive to sound, even lighting up from silent sounds far away (depending on the chosen value of course)<br><br>

8. Casing 3D print

## Software

1. [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/):

This is the software we used to program the Raspberry Pi 4. It's easy to set up after installing. An advantage of this software is the ability to work on the same project at the same time. Whenever one person changes something all other members see the changes on their own device live.

&nbsp;

2. Python coding environment:

VNC viewer has the ability to write code in the program itself, opening the right type of file in your folder.
